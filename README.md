# standard-aws
My standard AWS setup for side projects

A simple set of scripts (mostly from AWS cloudformation examples) for bringing up an AWS infrastructure (VPC, Subnet, Network Routes, etc.)
and my standard set of Internet-facing instances.

Currently just brings up a single instance in the VPC, with a Jenkins master and build tools installed.
